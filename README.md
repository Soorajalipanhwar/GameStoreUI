# React + TypeScript + Vite + Bootstrap + Material UI
### Game Catelog UI
This is a React based frontend application that consumes the backend ASP.NET Core Web API [GameStoreAPI](https://github.com/Soorajalipanhwar/GameStore_ASP.NET_Core_Web_API).
The Project uses Material UI elements with Bootstrap styles to make the UI appealing.
I have used TypeScript in this project as it provides more features then the javaScript.
